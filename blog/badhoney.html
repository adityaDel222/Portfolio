            <h1>Bad Honey</h1>
            <p>The recent report published by CSE India in connection with the investigation carried out to understand adulteration of honey places our years of trust, we, as consumers put, in peril. Not only did the results sent shock waves among the consumers but also opened doors for a multitude of questions. The survey reveals that a majority of all the brands tested found to have been adulterated. Now this is bound to come as a shock especially since most of these brands put in a lot of effort advertising how pure their products are. In fact, purity is the paramount differentiator and the parameter of quality most stressed upon when it comes to products such as honey.</p>
            <p>The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) claims to have unearthed some eye-opening facts stating 17 out of the total 22 samples comprising 13 brands tested, failed the adulteration tests conducted at Centre for Analysis and Learning in Livestock and Food (CALF), National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), Gujarat, India and 'a renowned food testing laboratory in Germany'. Now we do not know as to what this renowned testing laboratory is, thanks to certain 'terms and conditions with the laboratory' so for the time being, we are left to assume that the results are 100% credible and in due interest of the people.</p>
            <p>The test conducted shows that while all the major honey brands meet most of the FSSAI standards, they fail the Trace Marker for Rice syrup (TMR) and the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) tests conducted in Germany, which are not included in any current FSSAI standard. Most of the minor brands, on the other hand, did not even pass the standards laid by the FSSAI. This revelation has irked the owners of the couple famous brands so much so that they immediately found themselves lashing out at the CSE, labelling the tests as 'motivated' and 'aimed at maligning the brand' as well as aggressively increasing the advertisements both in print media as well updating their websites to include testimonials (which is kind of funny as they seem to have not only used the same name for a couple of feedbacks but also the same feedback for a couple of names!). One of the companies even went on to accuse the CSE of promoting German technology in India! Much against the Aatmanirbhar philosophy, so to speak.</p>
            <p>The leading brand, now in defence has produced its acclaimed FSSAI certificate stressing the fact that it adheres to all of the 22 FSSAI laid parameters guaranteeing 100% pure and unadulterated honey, completely disregarding the NMR and TMR tests conducted in Germany in an effort to compel people into believing that the indigenous tests are wholesome and anything and everything beyond the boundaries of the FSSAI can be deemed trivial, when the fact of the matter is that the tests conducted by FSSAI have been found to be inefficient when it comes to determining adulteration and confirmation of the origin of honey. The report even mentions a link to China!</p>
            <p>Instead of arriving at a conclusion, all that the recently concluded examination has resulted in, is confusion among the consumers. In the wake of the ongoing health crisis amidst the pandemic and the associated health risks at an all-time high, the question undoubtedly remains - among the German laboratory, who forbids disclosure of its identity and the FSSAI, who has been of late found to be suffering from a major loophole, who are we to believe?</p>
